# Introduction {#introduction}

### About this report
This Ecosystem Summary Report supports DFO's efforts to incorporate an ecosystem approaches into Fisheries Science and Resource Management in the Maritimes Region. The purpose of this report is to synthesize ecosystem information to inform an ecosystem approach, as highlighted in the modernized Fisheries Act ([2019; Bill C-68](https://lop.parl.ca/sites/PublicWebsite/default/en_CA/ResearchPublications/LegislativeSummaries/421C68E)). It aligns objectives broadly to those of the [Maritimes Ecosystem Based Management Framework](https://sites.google.com/view/ebminitiative/ebm-initiative-home), and regional/area-based objectives that contribute to Scientific Advice and Management Plans or other Harvest Strategies. This Ecosystem Report aims to support an integrative suite of ecosystem indicators relevant to a specific fisheries management area that can support DFO's Ecosystem Approaches to Fisheries Management ([EAFM](https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/fisheries-peches/initiatives/ecosystems-approach-approche-ecosystemique/index-eng.html)) and Ecosystem Based Fisheries Management ([EBFM](https://sites.google.com/view/maritimesebfmwg/home)).


### Report structure
This report outlines ecosystem objectives related to a specific management area (Table 1), and reviews relevant ecosystem indicator trends and the status of the most recent year(s) relative to a reference point (if available) or a long-term average. The results are synthesized to outline potential implications for the management area examined. Where relevant this document provides links to reports and resources for details and methodology. This report summarizes general ecosystem trends to support integration of ecosystem information and expertise into Science Advice (e.g. stock assessment) or Resource Management (e.g. Integrated Fisheries Management Plans), but is intended for a variety of users.

This is a summary of the best available information describing the ecosystem specific to the management areas within the Maritimes Region.

# A. Pressures and Stressors {#pressuresandstressors}

## Climate and oceanography 
The 4X area is strongly influenced by natural variability of the climate system (e.g., North Atlantic Oscillation) and, therefore, long-term monitoring is needed to determine how anthropogenic climate change is affecting ocean temperatures. The NAO index has been mostly positive for the last decade, which favours warm, salty conditions in 4X ([Petrie 2007](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3137/ao.450302)). 

Air temperature in the 4X area (Yarmouth, NS) has been increasing at a rate of 1.2°C/century. The sea surface temperature in the 4X area has been warming at a rate of about 0.5°C/decade over the last 40 years. The last two years reported by AZMP (2021-2022) were the two warmest years in 4X since the start of observations. 

### North Atlantic Oscillation Index
[Hebert et al. 2024](https://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2024/mpo-dfo/Fs97-18-380-eng.pdf) (see Section 2.1)


```{r nafo4xNAO,fig.align="center", echo = FALSE, out.width="60%",fig.pos='H', fig.cap="The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index, defined as the winter (December, January, February, March) 500 mb pressure Principal Component Analysis which is representative of the difference between the Icelandic low and Azores high. Thick line is a 5-year moving average. Climatological mean is shown as the solid line. Dashed lines are ±0.5 standard deviation (SD)."}

knitr::include_graphics(here("figures", "nao.png"))

```

- In 2023, the winter (December–March) North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index was below the 1991 – 2020 mean, –0.31 (–0.84 SD). A high NAO index corresponds to an intensification of the pressure difference between the Icelandic Low and the Azores High. Strong northwest winds, cold air and sea temperatures, and heavy ice in the Labrador Sea and on the NL shelf areas, are usually associated with a high positive NAO index ([Colbourne et al. 1994](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/E-Colbourne-2/publication/281064239_Climatic_changes_and_environmental_conditions_in_the_Northwest_Atlantic_1970-1993/links/55d31fc508aec1b0429f2dee/Climatic-changes-and-environmental-conditions-in-the-Northwest-Atlantic-1970-1993.pdf); Drinkwater 1996). The opposite response occurs during years with a negative NAO index.

- The NAO has been shown to strongly affect bottom temperature distributions throughout the region from the Labrador Shelf to the Gulf of Maine ([Petrie 2007](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3137/ao.450302)). The response is bimodal, the product of direct and advective effects, with positive (negative) NAO generally corresponding to colder- (warmer-) than-normal bottom temperatures over the Labrador-Newfoundland Shelf, the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and the Eastern Scotian Shelf, and warmer- (colder-) than-normal conditions on the Central and Western Scotian Shelf and in the Gulf of Maine. 


### Sea Surface Temperature Anomaly
[Hebert et al. 2024](https://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2024/mpo-dfo/Fs97-18-380-eng.pdf) (see Section 3)

```{r nafo4xSSTanomaly,fig.show='hold',fig.align="center", echo = FALSE,fig.width = 5, out.width="50%", fig.cap="The annual sea-surface-temperature normalized anomaly for NAFO 4X eastern Gulf of Maine Bay of Fundy (top plot), and NAFO 4X (bottom plot) derived from satellite imagery compared to their long-term monthly means. Horizontal dashed lines represent plus or minus 0.5 SD for the 1991-2020 period. Regime shift analysis results from running the method forwards and backwards on the time series depicted by the blue and red horizontal lines, respectively. "}

knitr::include_graphics(here("figures", c("sstSatelliteAnnualAnomaly_regimeShift_4XeGoM+BoF.png","sstSatelliteAnnualAnomaly_regimeShift_4XSS.png")))


```

- The annual anomalies during 2023 was  +1.1◦C (+1.5 SD) in eastern Gulf of Maine/Bay of Fundy and +0.8 ◦C (+1.0 SD) in 4X on the Scotian Shelf. SST remained above normal, with the last three years being the three warmest years in 4XSS. NAFO division 4X eastern Gulf of Maine/Bay of Fundy remained above normal, but was cooler than the previous two years. A regime shift algorithm to detect a step change using mean levels was applied to the annual time-series (Rodionov 2004). Over the length of the record, the temperature has three distinct periods at all regions, a relatively cooler period from 1982 to 1993, near the climatological mean from 1994 to 2011, and a relatively warmer period from 2012 to present.


### Bottom Temperature Anomaly
[Hebert et al. 2024](https://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2024/mpo-dfo/Fs97-18-380-eng.pdf) (see Section 8.2)

```{r nafo4xBTanomaly,fig.align="center", echo = FALSE, fig.width = 5,fig.pos='H', out.width="60%", fig.cap="Time series of July bottom-temperature anomalies (thin lines with circles) and five-year-running-mean filtered series (heavy line) for NAFO 4X The solid horizontal line is the 1991-2020 mean and dashed lines represent ±0.5 SD. Regime shift analysis results from running the method forwards and backwards on the time series depicted by the blue and red horizontal lines, respectively."}


knitr::include_graphics(here("figures", "annualAnomaly_regimeShift_4X.png"))

```

- A total of 203 Conductivity-Temperature-Depth (CTD) stations were sampled. The survey covered part of Eastern Georges Bank (NAFO Division 5Ze), to the mouth of the Bay of Fundy (northwest portion of NAFO Division 4X), and spanned the entirety of the Scotian Shelf up to Cabot Strait (NAFO Divisions 4X, 4W, 4Vs, and 4Vn). The near-bottom temperature anomalies for 2023 were near normal on Eastern Georges Bank, to the mouth of the Bay of Fundy, and the western portion of 4X. On the eastern portion of 4X bottom temperatures were above normal. The anomaly varied for the NAFO Division was +0.3◦C (+0.3 SD) for 4X (the last two years were the warmest on record; 2012 was the record high). All regions show elevated bottom temperatures since approximately year 2010.

- Over the past two decades, the Scotian Shelf has incurred rapid warming due to the increased dominance of Warm Slope Water. 
- SST in the NAFO 4X area has varied around the long-term mean between 2016-2020, however bottom temperature in NAFO 4X has remained higher than average. 

## Longer-term climate change 

Ocean model long-term forecast and projections provide a general expectation of how the world may change. Ocean model projections use low and high emissions pathways as future scenarios to frame expectations of the future ocean climate.

knitr::include_graphics(here("figures", "SSPs_2040P_change_annual.png"))
```

- In 4X by 2050, the onset of spring is expected to occur 3-4 weeks earlier than present day and the growing season is expected to last 4-6 weeks longer ([Brickman & Shackell, 2024](https://online.ucpress.edu/elementa/article/12/1/00001/203135)) 

- Projected changes in sea surface temperature (2040-2059 relative to present day) for the Scotian Shelf and Gulf of Maine range from approximately 1.5 to 2.5°C (based on IPCC scenarios SSP2-4.5 to SSP5-8.5) ([Wang et al, 2024](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07055900.2023.2264832)).  

- NAFO Division 4X is in the southerly area of the NW Atlantic, where many species are at the southerly part of their range. Combined with a rapidly changing ocean, we can expect shifts in productivity and distribution, as well as shifts in the seasonal timing of their reproductive cycles.

- By 2050, a valuable species such as lobster is not expected to be vulnerable in Lobste Fishing Area (LFA) 34 and offshore in 4X, but does show increased vulnerability in the Bay of Fundy ([Greenan et al. 2019](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/marine-science/articles/10.3389/fmars.2019.00579/full)). By 2100, under both low and high emissions scenario, most marine species across the Canadian portion of the NW Atlantic are from moderate to high climate risk, and indeed, are at a lower risk compared to many areas around the globe, especially tropical ecosystems. While the NW Atlantic is warming rapidly, the resident species are, on average, widespread across the seascape, and are accustomed to a wider range of temperatures ([Boyce et al. 2024](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44183-024-00067-5)). However, formerly commercial but now depleted spp will be at much greater risk due to their low population sizes  ([Boyce et al. 2024](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44183-024-00067-5), see Fig 5 for list).

- The latest robust estimates of overall fishing pressure in 4X (2020) has been below the long-term average since around 2005, but increased to above average in 2019. This is due to fishing pressure on forage fish in the area which has been steadily increasing between 2016-2020 and is above the long-term average. This is likely influenced primarily by low biomass estimates for forage fish during this period (Figure 12) since landings have not increased (Figure 8). 

- Fishing pressure on gadoids and invertebrates have been below the long term mean since the late 1990s and late 2000s, respectively.

## Productivity 
Productivity relates to the amount of energy or biomass generated in an ecosystem, providing energy to consumers.  

### Nitrate, Chlorophyll, Bloom Start, *Calanus finmarchicus*,  Zooplankton Biomass

- Although recent warming would suggest a shift to higher nutrient concentrations across the Scotian Shelf (SS) region, recent evaluation of the long-term trends in nutrient availability across the SS has actually shown a decrease in nutrient availability since 2010, the onset of this warming period.

- In the most recent year, surface Cholorphyll in NAFO 4X has been high, with a general increase in the timing of bloom start (later). 

- The most recent estimates in NAFO 4X of abundance of *C. finmarchicus* and biomass of zooplankton have been lower than the long-term average.

### Large Fish Indicator (LFI)

[Bundy et al. 2017](https://publications.gc.ca/site/eng/9.845487/publication.html) (see Table S4 for definitions and details)

LFI is an estimate of the proportion of large fish in the community or proportion of biomass occupying the top predator trophic-level ([Greenstreet and Rogers 2006](https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article/63/4/573/690519#139793319)). 

```{r fig.align="center", echo = FALSE,fig.width = 5, fig.height=4,fig.pos='H', fig.cap="Large fish indicator from RV survey data. Dotted line denotes the long-term mean, grey area represents the most recent 5 years of available data."}

LFI<-eco_indicators_nafo %>%
  filter(ID=="4X", YEAR<2021)%>%
        select(YEAR, LargeFishIndicator)

    
  mean_LFI <- LFI %>% summarise(mn=mean(LargeFishIndicator))
 
  
  pd<-ggplot(LFI, aes(x = YEAR, y = LargeFishIndicator)) +
  theme_classic()+
  geom_line(size=1)+

           ymin = -Inf, ymax = Inf,
           fill = "grey", alpha = 0.2)

```
- LFI in the NAFO 4X area has varied over time, but in the last 5 year period it has been low or below average.

## Biodiversity 
Biodiversity is described as the variety and variability among living organisms from all sources ([CBD](https://www.cbd.int/convention)). It is linked to ecosystem resilience and plays an important role in maintaining functionality and productivity of ecosystems. Biodiversity can relate to genetic, species, guild and ecosystem diversity. 

### Shannon Diversity Index, Margalef Richness, Heip's Evenness
[Bundy et al. 2017](https://publications.gc.ca/site/eng/9.845487/publication.html) (see Table S4)

Shannon Diversity Index accounts for both abundance and evenness of species present in a community. Margalef Richness measures the number of species present accounting for sampling effects. Heips Evenness measures how equally the species richness contributes to the total abundance or biomass of the community. Due to improvements in species identification over time, long-term Shannon Diversity and Margalef richness can be misleading. Only years 2000-2020 were used here. 

```{r fig.align="center", echo = FALSE,fig.width = 10, fig.height=7,fig.pos='H', fig.cap="Shannon diversity Index, Margalef Richness, Hieps Evenness measured from data collected from DFO's Summer RV survey and has been corrected for catchability. Dotted lines denote long-term means, grey area represent the latest 5 years of available data."}

- There is relative stability of Margalef Richness in the last 5 years, but declines in latest year for Shannon Diversity and Heip's evenness.

### Guild-level Biomass

[Bundy et al. 2017](https://publications.gc.ca/site/eng/9.845487/publication.html) (see Table S4 for definitions, see Table S5 for species categories)

Guild-level biomasses address structural attributes of food webs, and can also serve as proxies for ecosystem functioning ([Tam et al. 2017](https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article/74/7/2040/2970046)).This indicator includes multiple guilds for fish and invertebrates from the RV Survey.

- Total biomass of commercial fish species are generally decreasing over the last 5 years, with both invertebrates and forage fish experiencing decreases in the most recent year. 
- Gadoid biomass has varied around the long term mean since the 1970s, however have been generally decreasing since 2014. 
- Forage fish have been declining over the last 5 year period and below the long-term mean. Biomass of forage fish is the lowest since the beginning of Summer RV survey records.
